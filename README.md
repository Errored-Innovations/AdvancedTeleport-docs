# Home

Welcome to the AdvancedTeleport wiki!

This is a plugin written by Niestrat99 and Thatsmusic99 - it has been in ongoing development since 2019. It now looks to change how teleportation is used in Minecraft servers.

### Requirements

AdvancedTeleport is intended for use from 1.8.x to 1.19.x. When a new Minecraft version (major or minor) is released, it is expected to work without issues. Nonetheless, the plugin is tested as soon as possible following release.

For economy support, [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) and an economy plugin of your choice (such as Essentials) is required.

Spigot is the minimum software supported by AdvancedTeleport - Paper is required to validate performance concerns. Since AT is a teleport plugin, it is expected to have a performance impact by loading chunks when teleporting, especially randomly. However, I (Thatsmusic99) am especially knowledgeable with server optimisation, and I will be more than happy to help ensure your server can run properly with the plugin.

### Building

AdvancedTeleport is open-source on Github [here](https://github.com/Niestrat99/AT-Rewritten). To build the plugin, the command used is `mvn clean install -Denv.BUILD_NUMBER=PRIVATE`, where the build number is set to private and nothing else.

### Support

Although AdvancedTeleport has a discussion forum on Spigot, the main form of support most people look for is through our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mgWbbN4) server. If you believe you have found a bug or have a suggestion, you are also free to have it posted on [Github](https://github.com/Niestrat99/AT-Rewritten/issues).
