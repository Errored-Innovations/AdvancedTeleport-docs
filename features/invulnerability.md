# 🛡️ Invulnerability

## Commands

The following commands allow players to become temporarily invulnerable:

* [`/tpa`](../commands/member-commands.md#tpa)&#x20;
* [`/tpahere`](../commands/member-commands.md#tpahere)&#x20;
* [`/tpr`](../commands/member-commands.md#rtp)&#x20;
* [`/warp`](../commands/member-commands.md#warp)
* [`/spawn`](../commands/member-commands.md#spawn)
* [`/home`](../commands/member-commands.md#home)&#x20;
* [`/back`](../commands/member-commands.md#back)&#x20;

## Base Configuration

The option determining the default invulnerability period is the `invulnerability-duration` option in the config.yml file. It is measured in seconds.

```yaml
# How long the invulnerability period lasts in seconds.
invulnerability-duration: 0
```

To change the invulnerability per-command, `per-command-invulnerability` covers each configurable option.

```yaml
# Command-specific invulnerability durations.
per-command-invulnerability:
  # Invulnerability duration for /tpa.
  tpa: default
  # Invulnerability duration for /tpahere.
  tpahere: default
  # Invulnerability duration for /tpr, or /rtp.
  tpr: default
  # Invulnerability duration for /warp
  warp: default
  # Invulnerability duration for /spawn
  spawn: default
  # Invulnerability duration for /home
  home: default
  # Invulnerability duration for /back
  back: default
```

In order to change the invulnerability for a specific command, you can just replace `default` with the invulnerability duration you want, again in seconds:

```yaml
per-command-invulnerability:
  tpa: 5
```
