# 📥 Data Transfer Plugins

AdvancedTeleport allows the user to import and export data between itself and other plugins, making transferring for those switching from other plugins easy.&#x20;

## Essentials

The modern version of Essentials - by the EssentialsX team - is a plugin that allows data transfer between itself and AT. To import data from Essentials to AT, do `/at import essentials`, or to export data to Essentials from AT, do `/at export essentials`.

The following data can be exchanged between AT and Essentials:

<table><thead><tr><th width="238">Feature</th><th>Can be exchanged?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Homes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>/back locations</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Warps</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Spawns</td><td>Partially - AT's spawn system is fairly different and not all data may pass over.</td></tr><tr><td>Teleportation Status</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table>
